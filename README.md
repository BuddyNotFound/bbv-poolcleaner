**> BBV X WORLD | POOL CLEANER**

**Simple Pool cleaner job for both ESX/QB, works with qb-target/ox-target/bt-target.**

You can add as many jobs/locations as you want easily from the config just using vector3() and the script will generate the rest itself.

As always if you like my work you can leave a :heart: and feedback in comments.
If you find any issues you can report them on in our dc server or github.
